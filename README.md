## üåå Java Ray Tracer

A Ray Tracer written in Java capable of rendering 3D scenes using OBJ models, JPG textures, and a BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) structure for fast ray intersection tests.

## üöÄ Features

OBJ Model Loading
Parses .obj files to load meshes composed of triangles, vertices, normals, and UV coordinates.

JPG Texture Mapping
Reads .jpg textures directly from disk and applies them to OBJ surfaces using UV mapping.
(No external libraries ‚Äî textures are read and sampled manually.)

BVH Acceleration
Implements a Bounding Volume Hierarchy to speed up ray-triangle intersection checks, reducing render time significantly for large scenes.

Materials and Lighting

Diffuse and reflective surfaces

Point lights with ambient and specular shading

Adjustable intensity and color per light source

Custom Camera System
Configurable camera position, direction, and field of view for flexible scene composition.

BVH Overview

The BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) is constructed dynamically based on the number of triangles in the scene:

Each node contains an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) that encloses its child primitives.

Splitting is done by sorting primitives along the longest axis.

Ray intersections traverse the BVH recursively, testing only relevant bounding boxes instead of every triangle.

This results in a major performance boost for complex OBJ scenes with thousands of triangles.
